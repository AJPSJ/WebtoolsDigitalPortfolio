				<h1> WELCOME TO MY PAGE! </h1>
				&emsp; Hello! I go by the name Alexa Joanne Paula G. San Jose. I am a 1st year student in the University of makati
				enrolling in the course of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, majoring in Application Development. I've been
				a computer programming student since grade 8 of junior highschool, but our lessons never got past loops and have been
				unlucky with our teachers and their treatment. <br> <br>
				&emsp; I'm an introverted-extrovert who usually welcomes anyone who tries to understand and respect me, my time, and my space.
				I'm also someone who is seemingly troubled with everything no matter how simple they may be. I have no noteworthy hobbies to share,
				nor would I be comfortable of sharing them with just anyone if I did have some. <br> <br>
				&emsp; This page is simply a plump of randomness to its core. The contents offered here are of projects. If there are some out-of-place
				features in this website like the contact button below, they were just experimental that I supposedly wanted to implement in my website. 
				I have no intention to charm people with this. <br> <br>
				I'll let this be one of my form of therapies, but I doubt it'll ever work.
